##Problem Statement:

Write a function 'string shuffle(string s)' which rearranges the characters in the input so that the same character does not occur twice in a row (that is, next to each other). It should return the shuffled string, if it is not possible to rearrange the string, the function should return null.

## Expected Complexity:
  N - Length of String
 * Time - O(NlogN) 
 * Space - O(N)
